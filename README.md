# PID car simulator
I used to participated in robotic competitions serveral years ago and I had a chance to learn about pid algorithm.
I really want to do a lot more with this algorithm but my knowledge is not enough so I just create this instead.

<div>Error is the different between distances of 2 car front sensors and wall. </div>
<div>More P results in large angle change.</div>
<div>More I results in less turning radius (residual error in this case is the turning radius).</div>
<div>More D results in less oscillation.</div>
